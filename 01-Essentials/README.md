# 01-Essentials

## History

Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was created to allow programmers to write programs that were easier to read and write than most other programming languages. It was designed to be easy to learn and to use.

## Why Python

Every programming language have their uses and advantages. Python is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used in a wide range of fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and many others.

One of the main advantages of Python is its flexibility. It is easy to learn and to use. It is easy to extend and to customize. It is easy to create and to share.

Python have all the programming paradigms, or in other words, it has a lot of different ways to write programs. So is correct to say that Python is a structured language, a functional language and a Object Oriented language too.

Python is "batteries included". It comes with a large library of modules that can be used to build programs.

You can check out the [list of builtin modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) in the Python documentation.

Python have a large community of users and developers, and that community grows every year.
Python is open source.
Python is easy to learn.
Python is easy to use.
Python is easy to extend.
Python is easy to customize.
Python is easy to create.
Python is easy to share.

## Installation

Bellow you can check the installation of Python on your computer.

To this course, we will use python version 3 (last version is 3.10). Python 2.7 is very old

### Linux

Every Linux distribution comes with a Python installation. To check if you have Python installed, you can use the command:

```bash
#this will print the version of Python installed

python --version

```

To install on Ubuntu or Debian (two popular distributions of linux), you can use the following command:

```bash

    sudo apt install python3

```

### Mac OS

To install on Mac OS, you can use the following command:

```bash
    # install using brew
    brew install python3

    # check version
    python3 --version

```

### Windows

To install on Windows, you can use the download link from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Choose the Python 3.10 [Windows installer (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.3/python-3.10.3-amd64.exe)

Next next install ...

check the version of Python installed in cmd (press windows key + r and type cmd):

```bash

python --version

```

## IDE's

IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) are programs that help you to write and run your programs.

The most common and recommended IDE's for python are:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Free and open source.
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) Have a free community edition.

But you can use any IDE that you want, indeed, to follow this course you only need a text editor and a command line.

## Hello World (Basic Syntax) and Challenge

Open the script.py, read and follow the instructions.

To check if you have done it correctly, run the script and see the output.

```bash

python3 script.py

```

To test your code and pass the challenge, run the script and see the output.

```bash

pytest test_script.py

```
