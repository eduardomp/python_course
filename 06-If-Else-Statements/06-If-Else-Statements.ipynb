    "# 06-If-Else-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    if age >= 16:                    \n",
    "       print(\"You can drive in US!\") \n",
    "    elif age >= 18:                  \n",
    "        print(\"You can drive!\")\n",
    "    else:                            \n",
    "        print(\"Be health, ride a bike!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you can use if statements to controll the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module you will recap the logic operators to use in if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equals: a == b\n",
    "- Not Equals: a != b\n",
    "- Less than: a < b\n",
    "- Less than or equal to: a <= b\n",
    "- Greater than: a > b\n",
    "- Greater than or equal to: a >= b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Identation is very important in Python. With identation, is possible to delimit the scope of execution of your code, so in every python code, the identation is checked:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if age > 18:\n",
    "print(\"You got an error!\") # this code is not idented\n",
    "\n",
    "#Right way\n",
    "\n",
    "if age > 18:\n",
    "    print(\"OK\")            # this code is idented\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short hand If and If-Else (Ternary Operators)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your if statements \"inline\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This form is called \"Ternary Operators\", and can be used in simple expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 330\n",
    "\n",
    "# If\n",
    "if a > b: print(\"a is greater than b\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# If-Else\n",
    "print(\"A\") if a > b else print(\"B\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested If\n",
    "\n",
    "Its possible to write nested Ifs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coins = 1000\n",
    "name = \"Mario\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if coins >= 1000:\n",
    "    if name == \"Mario\":\n",
    "        print(\"You can enter in the castle sir!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Please, wait here!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Stay away or I will call the police!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### in - not in\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator \"in\" and \"not\" can be used to check items inside a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "pizza_ingredients = [\"pineapple\",\"chocolate\",\"salt\",\"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"pineapple\" in pizza_ingredients:\n",
    "    print(\"Yuummmyy :P\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "if \"pepperoni\" not in pizza_ingredients:\n",
    "    print(\"can I call this \\\"pizza\\\"?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### and\n",
    "\n",
    "To create more complex and easy to read boolean sentences, use the operator \"and\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pizza_ingredients = [\"pineapple\",\"chocolate\",\"salt\",\"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"pineapple\" in pizza_ingredients and \"pepperoni\" not in pizza_ingredients :\n",
    "    print(\"really?\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### or\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the operator \"or\" too:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pizza_ingredients = [\"pineapple\",\"chocolate\",\"salt\",\"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"pineapple\" in pizza_ingredients or \"pepperoni\" in pizza_ingredients :\n",
    "    print(\"Yuummmy\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
