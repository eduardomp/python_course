    "# 06-If-Else-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    if age >= 16:                    \n",
    "       print(\"You can drive in US!\") \n",
    "    elif age >= 18:                  \n",
    "        print(\"You can drive!\")\n",
    "    else:                            \n",
    "        print(\"Be health, ride a bike!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you can use if statements to controll the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module you will recap the logic operators to use in if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equals: a == b\n",
    "- Not Equals: a != b\n",
    "- Less than: a < b\n",
    "- Less than or equal to: a <= b\n",
    "- Greater than: a > b\n",
    "- Greater than or equal to: a >= b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Identation is very important in Python. With identation, is possible to delimit the scope of execution of your code, so in every python code, the identation is checked:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if age > 18:\n",
    "print(\"You got an error!\") # this code is not idented\n",
    "\n",
    "#Right way\n",
    "\n",
    "if age > 18:\n",
    "    print(\"OK\")            # this code is idented\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short hand If and If-Else (Ternary Operators)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your if statements \"inline\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This form is called \"Ternary Operators\", and can be used in simple expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 330\n",
    "\n",
    "# If\n",
    "if a > b: print(\"a is greater than b\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# If-Else\n",
    "print(\"A\") if a > b else print(\"B\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested If\n",
    "\n",
    "### and\n",
    "\n",
    "### or\n",
    "\n"
